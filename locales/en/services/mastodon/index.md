<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

Sign up for any Mastodon based service. [Here are a few you can choose from today](https://joinmastodon.org/servers).

In the **Settings** of your account, you can access the **Development** tab and create an **Application**. This is what Apprise will use to send your notifications.

At the bare minimum you need to grant the following scopes on your application:

- `write:statuses`: So Apprise can post a message
- `write:media`: So Apprise can send an attachment
- `read:accounts`: If you want to be able to send a DM to yourself

**Note**: If you change/add/remove scope entries associated with your Mastodon Application, you **MUST** regenerate your **Access Token** or your app will not take in effect the scope changes.

After you create your Application, revisit it's configuration as it will now provide you with a `key`, `secret`, and `access_token`. You ONLY need the **Access Token** to have Apprise work.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `mastodon://{token}@{host}`
- `mastodons://{token}@{host}`
- `toot://{token}@{host}`
- `toots://{token}@{host}`
- `mastodon://{token}@{host}/{targets}`
- `mastodons://{token}@{host}/{targets}`
- `toot://{token}@{host}/{targets}`
- `toots://{token}@{host}/{targets}`

Simply use `mastodon://` or `toot://` if access in an insecure server and `mastodons://` or `toots://` if accessing a secure one (https).

| token      | Yes      | The Access Token associated with the Application you created (in Mastodon's Account Settings). Your token MUST have at the bare minimum `write:statuses` access. Additionally provide `write:media` if you intend to provide attachments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| visibility | No       | The Mastodon visibility you want to operate in. Possible values are<br/> `direct` for Private Direct Messages)<br/>`private` for posts that will be visible only to followers<br/>`unlisted` for posts that will be public but not appear on the public timeline<br/>`public` for public posts<br/>`default` for post visibility based on the accounts _default-visiblity_ setting. <br/><br/>By default if `toot://` is used, it is presumed you want a public post (unless you explicitly specify the `visibility=` flag. However if you use `mastodon://` then your post by default will take on the _default-visibility_ associated with your account unless explicitly over-ridden here with the `visibility=`. |
| batch      | No       | By default images are batched together. However if you want your attachments to be posted 1 toot per attachment, set this to False.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| sensitive  | No       | If this is set to `Yes` then any attachments provided will be marked as sensitive.

<!-- GLOBAL:SERVICE:PARAMS -->

### Smart Processing

With Mastodon, routing of `direct` messages entirely depends on the `@users` identified in the message body. For this reason it's possible to post a status message like:

```bash
apprise -b "Hey guys, this message was sent from Apprise" \
   "mastodon://accesskey/host/@caronc?visibility=direct"
```

This will cause the message body to be created as

```text
Hey guys, this message was sent from Apprise @caronc
```

It's important to state that if you identify `/@users` entries on your Apprise URL, they will be appended into the message so they are notified. However, that said, if you prepare a URL for `direct` visibility and do not provide a user. Apprise will look up your own credentials automatically and send the message to yourself.

```bash
# Here is an example where we're specifying a `direct` message
# as our intentions are to create a DM.  This will cause Apprise to look
# ourselves up and notify our own account.  You MUST have the
# 'read:accounts' scope enabled on your Mastodon application or this
# will not work.
#
# Also consider there is overhead with this call as it requires an
# extra hit on the website to get your data.  For efficiency, it's
# ideal that you specify your @user if this is your intention.
apprise -b "Hey guys, this message was sent from Apprise" \
   "mastodon://accesskey/host/?visibility=direct"
```

Apprise is also smart enough to pre-scan the message being posted and if it finds a `@user` identified in the body that is also identified in the URL, it will NOT be added to the end of the body. Hence; consider a status message that reads:

```bash
apprise -b "Hey @caronc, Thanks for showing me the Apprise plugin!" \
   "mastodon://accesskey/host/@caronc?visibility=direct"
```

In the above case, `@caronc` is identified as both a target to be delivered to AND also already exists in the status message being sent. As a result, no `@caronc` will be appended at the end and the message will be sent as is.

```text
Hey @caronc, Thanks for showing me the Apprise plugin!
```

Let's do one more example just to show other cases:

Consider the following:

```bash
apprise -b "Hey @caronc, Thanks for showing me the Apprise plugin!" \
   "mastodon://accesskey/host/@caronc/@joe/@sam?visibility=direct"
```

The following has 3 people set up as targets, but it has already identified 1 of them in the message. The other 2 are automatically appended to the end of your status message:

```text
Hey @caronc, Thanks for showing me the Apprise plugin! @joe @sam
```

## Examples

Send a Mastodon toot:

```bash
# Assuming our {AccessKey} is T1JJ3T3L2
# Assuming our {Host} is noc.social
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   "mastodons://T1JJ3T3L2@noc.social"
```

Send a Mastodon DM to `@testaccount`:

```bash
# Assuming our {AccessKey} is T1JJ3T3L2
# Assuming our {Host} is noc.social
# our user is @testaccount
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   "mastodons://T1JJ3T3L2@noc.social/@testaccount?visibility=direct"
```

Send a Mastodon DM to ourselves using the built in smart-detection:

```bash
# Assuming our {AccessKey} is T1JJ3T3L2
# Assuming our {Host} is noc.social
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   "mastodons://T1JJ3T3L2@noc.social/?visibility=direct"
```
