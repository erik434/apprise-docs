## Service End Reason

It is hard to find much details on this project and whether or not it still exists in some form or another.

Here is the open source project that extended on this: <https://github.com/JohnPersano/SuperToasts>.

💡The Service was removed from Apprise in [apprise/46](https://github.com/caronc/apprise/issues/46)

<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

There isn't too much configuration for Super Toasty notifications. The message is basically just passed to your online Super Toasty account and then gets relayed to your device(s) you've setup from there.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `toasty://{user_id}@{device_id}`
- `toasty://{user_id}@{device_id1}/{device_id2}/{device_idN}`

## Parameter Breakdown

| Variable  | Required | Description                                                    |
| --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user_id   | Yes      | The user identifier associated with your Super Toasty account. |
| device_id | No       | The device identifier to send your notification to.            |

<!-- GLOBAL:SERVICE:PARAMS -->

## Examples

Send a Super Toasty notification a configured device:

```bash
# Assuming our {user_id} is nuxref
# Assuming our {device_id} is abcdefghijklmnop-abcdefg

```
