## Examples

Send a Voip.ms notification to ourselves:

```bash
# Assume:
#  - our {email} is test@example.com
#  - our {password} is abc123
#  - The {toPhoneNo} and {fromPhoneNo} is 6135551234
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   voipms://abc123:test@example.com/6135551234
```

Send a Voip.ms notification to another device:

```bash
# Assume:
#  - our {email} is test@example.com
#  - our {password} is abc123
#  - The {fromPhoneNo} is 6135551234
#  - The {ToPhoneNo} is 5645554321
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   voipms://abc123:test@example.com/6135551234/5645554321
```

## Troubleshooting

There have been cases where error messages would be sent back from the VoipMS Server that are not very descriptive to what the issue is. The key things you need to verify for this service to work is:

- Account has credits available to use
- SMS/MMS is enabled (see **Setup** section above)

In certain cases, it's possible that the Carrier you were delivering to was unable to send the message.
