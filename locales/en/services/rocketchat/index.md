<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Syntax

Rocket.Chat can send notifications through the following **modes**:

- **webhook**: A configured Incoming Webhook; this can be set up in the **Administration** area under **Integrations** heading.
- **basic**: A user/password combination.

Secure connections (via https) should be referenced using **rockets://** where as insecure connections (via http) should be referenced via **rocket://**.

### Basic Mode

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `rocket://{user}:{password}@{hostname}/#{channel}`
- `rocket://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/#{channel}`
- `rocket://{user}:{password}@{hostname}/{room_id}`
- `rocket://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{room_id}`
- `rockets://{user}:{password}@{hostname}/#{channel}`
- `rockets://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/#{channel}`
- `rockets://{user}:{password}@{hostname}/{room_id}`
- `rockets://{user}:{password}@{hostname}:{port}/{room_id}`

**Note:** the `?avatar=yes` option will only work if your user has the `bot` permission setting.

You can also form any combination of the above and perform updates from one url:

- **rocket**://**{user}**:**{password}**@**{hostname}**/#**{channel_id}**/**{room_id}**

For the Basic Mode Only: if neither a **{room_id}** or **#{channel}** is specified then this notification will fail.

### Webhook Mode

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `rocket://{webhook}@{hostname}/#{channel}`
- `rocket://{webhook}@{hostname}/{room_id}`
- `rocket://{webhook}@{hostname}/{@user}`
- `rockets://{webhook}@{hostname}/#{channel}`
- `rockets://{webhook}@{hostname}:{port}/#{channel}`
- `rockets://{webhook}@{hostname}/{room_id}`
- `rockets://{webhook}@{hostname}:{port}/{room_id}`

You can also form any combination of the above and perform updates from one url:

- **rocket**://**{webhook}**@**{hostname}**:**{port}**/#**{channel_id}**/**{room_id}**/**@{user}**

By default a webhook is set up to be associated with a channel. Thus the following syntax is also valid:

- **rocket**://**{webhook}**@**{hostname}**/

**Note:** Some webhooks have slashes in them. For these you need to make sure you escape the slash (`/`) with `%2F`. So your URL may look like:

- `rocket://abcd%2F12345@{hostname}/` - Note the `%2F` (to swap out for `/` found in webhook)
