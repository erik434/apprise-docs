<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

Brevo is a transactional email platform that exposes a JSON HTTP API for sending mail. The new `NotifyBrevo` plugin integrates this API with Apprise, using a URL schema consistent with other email providers such as SendGrid and Resend. The plugin:

1. Visit [https://www.brevo.com/](https://www.brevo.com/) and sign in to your Brevo account.
2. Navigate to **SMTP & API** in your account, then create a **Transactional email API key** with permission to send email.
3. Copy the generated **API key**. This will be used as the `APIToken` part of your Apprise URL.
4. Ensure you have at least one verified sender address or authenticated sending domain configured in Brevo. The **From Email** used in Apprise must be a valid sender, or Brevo will reject the request.
5. Construct your `brevo://` URL using the syntax below, substituting your API key, From address, and target recipients.
6. Use this URL in your Apprise configuration file or CLI calls.

⚠️ Brevo may send you a confirmation email (`subject: Security Alert: Verify a new IP`) indicating that `Someone tried to use your organization account and make an API call with an IP address you have never used before. We wanted to check this activity with you.`. You then need to use the confirmation link to approve the IP in question. From that point forward Apprise should work uninterrupted.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

- Single sender, default recipient (self-notification). Note that the 'From Email' must be a 'Verified Sender' already with Brevo for this syntax to work.
  - `brevo://APIToken:FromEmail`

- Explicit recipients:
  - `brevo://APIToken:FromEmail/ToEmail`
  - `brevo://APIToken:FromEmail/ToEmail1/ToEmail2/ToEmailN`

- Additional parameters:
  - `?to=extra1@example.com,extra2@example.com`
  - `?cc=cc1@example.com,cc2@example.com`
  - `?bcc=bcc1@example.com,bcc2@example.com`
  - `?reply=Reply Name <reply@example.com>`

The plugin URL template is:

- `{schema}://{apikey}:{from_email}`
- `{schema}://{apikey}:{from_email}/{targets}`
