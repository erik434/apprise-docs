<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

You need to set up a [Threema Gateway](https://gateway.threema.ch/) account first, which will allow you to request and access one or more 8-character Gateway IDs (each starting with an asterisk (`*`), e.g., `*THREEMA`).

**Important**: Please make sure to request a "Basic" ID for now, as end-to-end encrypted Threema Gateway messages are not yet supported by Apprise. End-to-end Gateway IDs cannot be used for sending Simple Messages (encrypted on Threema Servers).

- Create your Threema Gateway account at <https://gateway.threema.ch/>, and confirm your e-mail address
- For credits:
  - Ask Threema Gateway support via e-mail (support-gateway at threema.ch) for test credits, and they will get you covered for some testing
  - OR acquire them after logging into your Gateway account.
- [Request](https://gateway.threema.ch/en/id-request?type=simple) your Simple Gateway ID. After a short review, Threema will then create your ID, and you will find the corresponding ID secret on the ID overview page. This usually takes no more than one or two business days.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{user}`
- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{user1}/{user2}/{user3}/{userN}`
- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{email}`
- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{email1}/{email2}/{email3}/{emailN}`
- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{phone}`
- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{phone1}/{phone2}/{phone3}/{phoneN}`

You can also freely mix/match the variables:

- `threema://{gateway_id}@{secret}/{phone1}/{user1}/{email1}/...`
