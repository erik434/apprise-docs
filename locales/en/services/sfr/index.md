```bash
# Assuming our {user} is foo
# Assuming our {password} is bar
# Assuming our {space_id} is 1234
# Assuming our {PhoneNo} - is in the US somewhere making our country code +1
#                        - identifies as 800-555-1223
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   sfr://foo:bar@1234/18005551223

# the following would also have worked (spaces, brackets,
# dashes are accepted in a phone no field):
apprise -vv -t "Test Message Title" -b "Test Message Body" \
   sfr://foo:bar@1234//1-(800) 555-1223
