<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

You need to have an account with [Burst SMS](https://burstsms.com/). Visit your profile options and create a `Secret` to associate with your account. You'll notice that there is already an `API Key` present. These will be used for your credentials.

Burst SMS will set you up with a Sender ID that you're notifications will originate from. This must be provided as part of the Apprise URL as well.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

- `burstsms://{api_key}:{secret}@{sender_id}/{targets}`
