<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup
Boxcar just has a development platform these days.  You can't get notifications through your AppleOS or Android devices anymore. You can still however sign up for an account [on their website](https://boxcar.io/). From there you can create projects through them.

Each _project_ you create with them will grant you access to your own unique **Access Key** and a **Secret Key**. You can post notifications knowing these 2 values.

## Syntax
Valid authentication syntaxes are as follows:
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}`

Tags support:
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}/@{tag_id}`
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}/@{tag_id01}/@{tag_id02}/@{tag_idNN}`

Device Tokens:
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}/{device_id}`
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}/{device_id01}/{device_id02}/{device_idNN}`

You can also form any combination of the above and perform updates from one url:
* `boxcar://{access_key}/{secret_key}/@{tag_id}**/{device_id}`

## Parameter Breakdown
| Variable    | Required | Description
| ----------- | -------- | -----------
| access_key  | Yes      | This is required for your account to work. You will be provided one from boxcar's website upon creating an account with them.
| secure_key  | Yes      | This is required for your account to work. You will be provided one from boxcar's website upon creating an account with them.
| device_id   | No       | Associated devices with your Boxcar setup. All _device_ids_ are 64 characters in length.
| tag_id      | No       | Tags must be prefixed with a @ symbol or they will be interpreted as a _device_id_ and/or _alias_.

<!-- GLOBAL:SERVICE:PARAMS -->

## Example
