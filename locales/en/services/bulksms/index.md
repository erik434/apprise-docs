<!-- SERVICE:DETAILS -->

## Account Setup

Sign up for BulkSMS account [from here](https://bulksms.com). You will be provided to create a user and password to associate with your account.  This is all you need to use this through Apprise.

## Syntax

Valid syntax is as follows:

* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{target}`

A `target` can be either a phone number, or if prefixed with `@` it becomes a group.

* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{phoneNo}`
* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{phoneNo1}/{phoneNo2}/{phoneNoN}`
* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{group}`
* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{group1}/@{group2}/@{groupN}`

You can mix and match as well

* `bulksms://{user}:{password}@{to_phone1}/@{group1}`

For ambiguity, if you do not provide a valid phone number, and the information parsed does not exclusively have a`@` in front of it, then it is first interpreted as phone number.  However if alphanumeric characters are detected in it, then it is switched to a group.

## Parameter Breakdown

| --------------- | -------- | ----------- |
| user    | Yes      | The username associated with your BulkSMS Account. |
| password    | Yes      | The password associated with your BulkSMS Account. |
| to         | **\*No**   | A phone number and/or group you wish to send your notification to. You can use comma's to separate multiple entries if you wish. This is an alias to `targets`. |

| route | No | Can be set to either `ECONOMY`, `STANDARD`, or `PREMIUM`  (not case sensitive). If not otherwise provided, this assumes to be `STANDARD` by default. |
| unicode     |  No  | Optionally tell Apprise to not mark your text message as having unicode characters in it.  The message mode changes to `TEXT` if this is set to `No` |
