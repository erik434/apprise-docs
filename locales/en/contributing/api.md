## Contributing to Apprise API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Apprise API.

This repository is the web application and API layer that wraps the Apprise core library. Contributions are welcome across code, bug fixes, UI improvements, documentation, and deployment tooling.

## Retrieve from GitHub

```bash
git clone git@github.com:caronc/apprise-api.git
cd apprise-api
```

## Development Environment

Apprise API supports both a local (bare metal) workflow and a Docker Compose workflow.

### Bare Metal

Start the development server in debug mode:

```bash
tox -e runserver
# visit: http://localhost:8000/
```

You can also bind to a different address or port:

```bash
tox -e runserver -- "localhost:8080"
tox -e runserver -- "0.0.0.0:8080"
```

### Docker Compose for Development

A fresh checkout can be run with Docker Compose, and the development flow mounts your local source tree into the container so changes are reflected without rebuilding:

```bash
# Pre-create the paths you will mount to
mkdir -p attach config plugin

# Run the stack
PUID=$(id -u) PGID=$(id -g) docker compose up
```

## Quality Assurance and Testing

This repository uses `tox` to keep linting, tests, and formatting consistent across contributor environments:

```bash
# Run unit tests
tox -e test

# Lint (calls ruff under the hood)
tox -e lint

# Auto-format
tox -e format
```

You can combine environments as well:

```bash
tox -e test,lint
```

If you prefer running tools directly (once dev dependencies are installed), the repository documents `pytest` and `ruff` as optional manual equivalents.

## Quick Checklist Before You Submit

- Your change includes tests when practical.
- `tox -e test` passes locally.
- `tox -e lint` passes locally.
- You ran `tox -e format` when formatting changes are needed.
- Your pull request description clearly explains what changed and why.

## Notes on Docker Compose Files

- For development, `docker compose up` will apply the override file automatically in a fresh checkout, and it is designed for live iteration.
- For production-style deployments, prefer the base Compose file only, so you are running the immutable image and bundled static assets.
