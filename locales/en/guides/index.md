Guides provide **hands-on, scenario-driven documentation** for using Apprise in real systems.

They are written for users who already understand the basics of Apprise and want clear, practical direction for specific platforms, tools, or workflows.

If you are looking for reference material, APIs, or configuration syntax, see the [Library](../library/), [CLI](../cli/), or [API](../api/) sections instead.

## Guides

- **[Using Apprise with Home Assistant](./hassio/)**: Learn how to integrate Apprise with Home Assistant to deliver notifications across multiple services using a single, consistent configuration.
  This guide covers common patterns, configuration examples, and practical considerations when running Apprise alongside Home Assistant.

## Growing This Section

The Guides section will expand over time to cover additional platforms and use cases, such as:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Container orchestration
- Monitoring and alerting systems
- Self-hosted notification hubs

### Contributing

If you have a real-world integration or workflow that others may benefit from, contributions are welcome!

Guides should remain:

- Practical
- Focused
- Grounded in real usage
- Free of speculative or experimental features

Please see our [Apprise Docs Contribution section](../contributing/documentation/).
