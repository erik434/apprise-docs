Apprise can be installed as a Python package, a system package on Linux, or run as a container. Choose the method that best fits your environment.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="PyPI (Standard)">

The most common way to install Apprise is via `pip`. This works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

```bash
pip install apprise
```

If you are not using a virtual environment or have proper rights on the machine you're using, you may need to use `pip3` or add the `--user` flag:

```bash
pip3 install apprise --user
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Linux Distributions">

Apprise is packaged as an RPM and available through [EPEL](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/epel/) supporting CentOS, Redhat, Rocky, and Oracle Linux.

### RedHat / Rocky / Oracle / Fedora

First, enable the EPEL repositories if you haven't already:

```bash
sudo dnf install epel-release
```

Then install Apprise:

```bash
sudo dnf install apprise
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem label="Docker">

Apprise is available as a lightweight Docker image. This is ideal if you want to run the Apprise API or keep the CLI isolated from your host system.

### Pull the Image

```bash
docker pull caronc/apprise:latest
```

### Run the CLI

You can run the `apprise` command directly through Docker without installing Python on your host:

```bash
# Send a notification via Docker
docker run --rm -it caronc/apprise \
    -t "Hello" -b "World" \
    "discord://webhook_id/webhook_token"
```

### Run the API Server

Or install the Graphical User Interface API version (Apprise API) from [here](https://github.com/caronc/apprise-api) to centralize your configuration and notifications through a manageable webpage.

```bash
# /config    is used for a spot to write all of the configuration files
#            generated through the API.
#            The internal persistent store lives under /config/store so a
#            single /config volume is sufficient.
# /plugin    is used for a location you can add your own custom apprise plugins.
#            You do not have to mount this if you don't intend to use it.
# /attach    is used for file attachments
#
# /tmp       Temporary files, suitable for `tmpfs` in hardened deployments.
#
# The below example sets a the APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT to a small value (over-riding
# a full production environment setting). This may be all that is needed for
# a light-weight self hosted solution.
#
# setting APPRISE_STATEFUL_MODE to simple allows you to map your defined {key}
# straight to a file found in the `/config` path. In simple home configurations
# this is sometimes the ideal expectation.
#
# Set your User ID or Group ID if you wish to over-ride the default of 1000
# in the below example, we make sure it runs as the user we created the container as

# pre-create your directories
mkdir -p /path/to/local/{config,plugin,attach}

docker run --name apprise \
   -p 8000:8000 \
   --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
   -v /path/to/local/config:/config \
   -v /path/to/local/plugin:/plugin \
   -v /path/to/local/attach:/attach \
   -e APPRISE_STATEFUL_MODE=simple \
   -e APPRISE_WORKER_COUNT=1 \
   -e APPRISE_ADMIN=y \
   -d caronc/apprise:latest
```
