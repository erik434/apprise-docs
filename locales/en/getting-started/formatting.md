Apprise can deliver **plain text**, **Markdown**, **HTML**, and **attachments**, then adapt what you send to what each service can actually accept. For example, a service that only supports text will still receive your notification, but any rich formatting will be reduced appropriately.

## Message Formats

Apprise does **not** automatically guess your content type. Instead, you tell Apprise **what kind of content you are providing**, and Apprise uses that knowledge to make intelligent, per-service delivery decisions.

Apprise recognises four **input format states**:

| State                 | Description                                                            |
| :-------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(implicit)_ **none** | No format declared. Content is passed through unchanged.               |
| **text**              | Plain text input. Apprise may simplify content for text-only services. |
| **markdown**          | Markdown input. Apprise may convert or simplify as needed.             |
| **html**              | HTML input. Apprise may strip or convert markup as required.           |

:::note

- The `none` state is implicit. It is used automatically when no format is provided.
- The `none` state cannot be explicitly set via the CLI, Library, or API.

  :::

**In short**: Apprise preserves your content whenever possible, and only adapts it when a destination cannot support what you provided.

### Declaring Input vs Transforming Output

When you specify a format (such as `text`, `markdown`, or `html`), you are **describing your input**, not forcing a specific output format.

Apprise uses this information to determine **whether any transformation is necessary** for a given destination.

- If the destination service natively supports the declared format, content is passed through unchanged
- If the destination cannot support the declared format, Apprise performs the minimal conversion required
- If no conversion is required, no transformation occurs

In other words, Apprise only intervenes **when there is a mismatch** between the declared input format and what the upstream provider can support. It can only do this when you have provided an input format to work with.

For example:

- An **HTML** message sent to Email may be delivered as rich HTML
- The **same HTML** message sent to SMS will be converted to readable plain text
- A **Markdown** message sent to a chat service may retain formatting
- That **same Markdown** message sent to a text-only service will be simplified automatically

This makes destinations more compatible _without_ requiring you to manually tailor content per service.

### What Happens if you do not Specify a Format?

If you do **not** specify a format, Apprise assumes slightly different states depending on which component you're using:

| Interface                    | Default input format                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [CLI](../../cli/)            | `text`                                                                                                                         |
| [Python API](../../library/) | `none` - content passed as is unless `body_format` is provided in the `notify()` call or preset in the `AppriseAsset()` object |
| [Apprise-API](../../api/)    | `none` - content passed as is unless `format` is provided in `/notify/` payload                                                |

With the exception of the CLI, if no `input_format` is specified:

- Content is passed **as-is**
- No conversion or sanitisation occurs within Apprise
- Any markup (HTML, Markdown, etc.) is treated as literal text

This behaviour is intentional and useful when:

- You already know the destination is text-only
- You want exact control over what is sent

Declaring the correct input format is optional, but doing so allows Apprise to assist more effectively across mixed destinations.

## CLI Examples

Use `--input-format` to tell Apprise how to interpret your body content.

```bash
# Markdown body
apprise -t "Release" -b "**v1.2.3** is now live" \
  --input-format=markdown \
  "discord://..."

# HTML body
apprise -t "Build Report" -b "<b>Success</b>: artifacts uploaded" \
  --input-format=html \
  "mailto://user:pass@example.com"
```

## Python Library Examples

Use `body_format` to specify the message format you are providing.

```python
from apprise import Apprise
from apprise import NotifyFormat

apobj = Apprise()
apobj.add("discord://...")

# Markdown input
apobj.notify(
    title="Status",
    body="**All checks passed**",
    body_format=NotifyFormat.MARKDOWN,
)

# HTML input
apobj.notify(
    title="Build Report",
    body="<b>Success</b>: artifacts uploaded",
    body_format=NotifyFormat.HTML,
)
```

## Apprise-API Examples

For JSON payloads, use the `format` field:

```bash
# Stateless Example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notify/ \
  -d 'urls=["discord://..."]' \
  -d 'title=Status' \
  -d 'body=**All checks passed**' \
  -d 'format=markdown'

# Stateful Example
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/notify/team-alerts/\
  -d 'tags=outage' \
  -d 'type=failure' \
  -d 'title=Outage Report' \
  -d 'body=<strong>File Server is no longer responding</strong>' \
  -d 'format=html'
```

If you're using Apprise already, consider just using the [Apprise API Service](../../services/apprise_api/) to simplify Stateful queries:

```bash
# --config= allows you to source an upstream Apprise API for your
# configuration.
apprise --config=http://localhost:8000/cfg/team-alerts/ \
  --tag=outage \
  --input-format=html \
  --notification-type=failure \
  --title "Outage Report" \
  --body "<strong>File Server is no longer responding</strong>"
```

:::tip[For Developers]
If you are already using the API heavily (especially for multi-language examples and multipart uploads), the [API Integrations](../../api/integrations/) page is the canonical reference.
:::

:::tip[For Admins]
Provided the Apprise API server has not enabled the `APPRISE_CONFIG_LOCK`, you can put your Apprise API configuration URL in one of the default configuations the Apprise CLI looks for to make your query even easier to use:

```yaml
# ~/.config/apprise/apprise.yaml
include http://localhost:8000/cfg/team-alerts/
```

Now your CLI command simplifies significantly:

```bash
apprise --tag=outage --input-format=html --notification-type=failure \
  --title "Outage Report" \
  --body "<strong>File Server is no longer responding</strong>"
```

## Selecting an Output Format (Upstream Delivery)

In addition to declaring the **input format**, some services allow you to select how content is delivered **upstream** by specifying a `format=` parameter directly in the service URL.

This does **not** describe the input you are providing. Instead, it instructs the service plugin which delivery route or representation to use, _if supported_.

### How Input and Output Formats Work Together

- **Input format** (`body_format`, `--input-format`, API `format`)  
  Tells Apprise _what kind of content you are providing_

- **Output format** (`?format=` on a service URL)  
  Tells the service plugin _how to deliver that content upstream_

When both are specified, Apprise will correctly adapt the content as needed before handing it off to the selected upstream delivery route.

If the upstream service does **not** support the requested output format, it is silently ignored and the service’s default behaviour is used instead.

### Examples

#### Email

Email supports multiple delivery formats.

```text
# Default behaviour (HTML email)
mailto://user:pass@example.com

# Force plain-text email delivery
mailto://user:pass@example.com?format=text
```

In this case:

- `format=html` is unnecessary because HTML is the default
- `format=text` explicitly selects the plain-text delivery route
- `format=markdown` is ignored because email does not support Markdown delivery

#### Services with Multiple Endpoints

Some services expose different API endpoints depending on format support.

In these cases, setting `format=` may:

- Select a different upstream endpoint
- Change how content is rendered by the service
- Bypass formatting transformations entirely

This behaviour is **plugin-specific** and only applies when the service explicitly supports multiple output formats.

### When Is This Useful?

Specifying an output format is useful when:

- You want to force a specific delivery type (for example, text-only email)
- The service supports multiple content representations
- You are sending content _as-is_ and need to route it through a specific upstream path

If a service does not support the requested output format, Apprise safely falls back to the default behaviour.

## Attachments

Attachments let you send files such as images, logs, PDFs, and artifacts alongside your message. Whether they arrive as true attachments depends on what the destination service supports.

### CLI attachments

Use `--attach` one or more times:

```bash
apprise -t "System Alert" -b "See attached log" \
  --attach /var/log/syslog \
  "mailto://user:pass@example.com"

apprise -b "Here are the files" \
  --attach /tmp/photo1.jpg \
  --attach /tmp/photo2.jpg \
  "tgram://..."
```

### Python Attachments

Pass a single path or a list of paths via `attach`:

```python
from apprise import Apprise

apobj = Apprise()
apobj.add("tgram://...")

# Single attachment
apobj.notify(body="See attached", attach="/path/to/file.txt")

# Multiple attachments
apobj.notify(
    body="Artifacts attached",
    attach=[
        "/path/to/build.log",
        "/path/to/report.pdf",
    ],
)
```

### Remote Attachments (URLs)

You can also provide a URL and Apprise will fetch it before delivering:

```python
# Apprise will download this image and send it to the destination
# if you provide a user/pass combo, it will even authenticate for you
# prior to retrieving the attachment
apobj.notify(
    body="Security Camera Snapshot",
    attach="http://admin:pass@example.local/cam/snapshot.jpg"
)
```

:::caution
If a remote attachment URL includes credentials, treat it like a secret. Avoid committing it into repositories or logs.
