# Apprise Documentation Style Guide

This guide describes **how we write documentation**, not what tools we use.

It exists to keep documentation clear, consistent, and welcoming, while still
allowing contributors to write in their own voice.

## Core Principles

### Clarity over cleverness

Prefer clear, direct language over wordplay or clever phrasing.

### Practical over theoretical

Show how something works before explaining why.

### Friendly but professional

Write as a helpful peer. Avoid marketing language or excessive formality.

### Assume the reader is new

Do not assume prior knowledge of Apprise unless stated.

## Tone and Voice

- Use a calm, confident tone
- Avoid sarcasm or humour that may not translate well
- Use second person (“you”) when appropriate
- Avoid imperative commands unless giving instructions

## Structure and Formatting

### Headings

- Use sentence case for headings
- Keep headings descriptive and short

### Paragraphs

- Keep paragraphs short (3–4 lines max)
- Prefer bullet lists for multiple related items

### Lists

- Use bullets for unordered lists
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps

## Examples

Examples are strongly encouraged.

Good examples:

- CLI commands
- URL examples
- Configuration snippets
- Small, focused code blocks

Avoid:

- Overly large examples
- Abstract placeholders without explanation

## Terminology

- Use consistent terminology across pages
- Prefer “notification service” over shorthand
- Avoid abbreviations unless commonly understood

## Service Documentation

When documenting a service:

- Describe what the service does before how to configure it
- Include at least one working example
- Document limitations clearly
- Mention upstream requirements where relevant

## Localization Considerations

- Avoid idioms and slang
- Keep sentences simple where possible
- Avoid culture-specific references

This helps translators and non-native readers.

## What This Guide Is Not

- It is not a strict rulebook
- It does not enforce a single writing style
- It should not discourage contributions

If in doubt, prioritize clarity and helpfulness.
